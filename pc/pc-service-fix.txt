// Replace lines 49-94 in pc.service.js with this:

        // Log what we're creating (for debugging)
        console.log('üîç PC Service - Creating PC with roomLocationId:', params.roomLocationId);
        
        // NOTE: We rely on the database foreign key constraint to validate room location
        // This avoids race conditions where the location exists when frontend loads it
        // but might be deleted/changed by the time we create the PC
