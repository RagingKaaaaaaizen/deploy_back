# Staff Stock Creation Workflow Verification

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Frontend Workflow (Staff User)

1. **Click "Add Stock" button** → Opens stock form modal
2. **Fill out stock form** → User enters item details (single or bulk)
3. **Click "Add Stock Item(s)" button** → Shows confirmation modal
4. **Confirmation Modal displays:**
   - Items summary with name, quantity, price, total, location
   - Message: "As a Staff member, these items will be sent for approval..."
   - Button: "Submit for Approval"
5. **Click "Submit for Approval"** → Shows loading state
6. **Success message**: "Stock entry submitted for approval. You will be notified once approved."

### ✅ Backend Workflow (Staff User)

1. **Stock Controller receives request** → Checks `req.user.role === 'Staff'`
2. **Creates approval request** → Calls `approvalRequestService.create()`
3. **Returns response** → `{ status: 'pending_approval', approvalRequestId: xxx }`
4. **No direct stock creation** → Stock is NOT added to inventory

### ✅ Admin/SuperAdmin Workflow

1. **Admin/SuperAdmin users** → Bypass approval workflow
2. **Direct stock creation** → Stock is added immediately to inventory
3. **Success message**: "Stock entry created successfully"

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- `stock-list.component.ts` - Main stock management component
- `confirmation-modal.component.ts` - Review and confirmation modal
- `stock.service.ts` - API service for stock operations

### Backend Components
- `stock.controller.js` - Handles stock creation with role-based logic
- `approval-request.service.js` - Manages approval requests
- `approval-request.model.js` - Database model for approval requests

## Testing Checklist

### ✅ Staff User Test
- [ ] Login as Staff user

- [ ] Fill out stock form with valid data
- [ ] Click "Add Stock Item(s)" button
- [ ] Verify confirmation modal appears
- [ ] Verify modal shows item details correctly
- [ ] Verify modal shows "Submit for Approval" button
- [ ] Click "Submit for Approval"
- [ ] Verify loading state appears
- [ ] Verify success message: "submitted for approval"
- [ ] Verify stock is NOT added to inventory immediately

### ✅ Admin User Test
- [ ] Login as Admin user
- [ ] Navigate to Stock Management → Add Stock
- [ ] Fill out stock form with valid data
- [ ] Click "Add Stock Item(s)" button
- [ ] Verify confirmation modal appears
- [ ] Verify modal shows "Add to Inventory" button
- [ ] Click "Add to Inventory"
- [ ] Verify success message: "created successfully"
- [ ] Verify stock IS added to inventory immediately

### ✅ Approval Process Test
- [ ] Admin/SuperAdmin can see pending approval requests
- [ ] Admin/SuperAdmin can approve/reject requests
- [ ] When approved, stock entries are added to inventory
- [ ] Staff user gets notified of approval/rejection

## Current Implementation Files

### Frontend Files Modified
- `src/app/stocks/stock-list.component.ts` - Main workflow logic
- `src/app/stocks/stock-list.component.html` - UI template
- `src/app/_components/confirmation-modal.component.ts` - Review modal

### Backend Files (Already Working)
- `stock/stock.controller.js` - Role-based stock creation
- `approval-requests/approval-request.service.js` - Approval management
- `approval-requests/approval-request.controller.js` - Approval endpoints

## Expected Behavior

### Staff User Experience
1. **Form Submission** → Confirmation modal with approval message
2. **Confirmation** → Creates approval request (not direct stock)
3. **Success Message** → "submitted for approval"
4. **No Direct Addition** → Stock not added until approved

### Admin/SuperAdmin Experience
1. **Form Submission** → Confirmation modal with direct addition message
2. **Confirmation** → Directly adds stock to inventory
3. **Success Message** → "created successfully"
4. **Immediate Addition** → Stock added right away

## Troubleshooting

### If Confirmation Modal Not Showing
- Check `onAddStockClick()` method calls `showConfirmationModal()`
- Verify `showConfirmationModalFlag` is set to true
- Check console for validation errors

### If Staff Stock Added Directly
- Verify backend role check: `req.user.role === 'Staff'`
- Check approval request creation in backend logs
- Verify response contains `status: 'pending_approval'`

### If Approval Requests Not Created
- Check `approvalRequestService.create()` is called
- Verify database connection and approval_requests table
- Check backend logs for errors

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete workflow** with actual Staff and Admin users
2. **Verify approval requests** are created in database
3. **Test approval process** from Admin side
4. **Verify notifications** work correctly
5. **Test edge cases** (invalid data, network errors, etc.)
